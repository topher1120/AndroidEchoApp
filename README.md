# Android Echo Activity #
This application is a sample Android application exploring sending a REST request to a server and receiving results back asynchronously.  
At present moment, this app expects a REST service to echo it's value back.  See the Echo Server ([https://github.com/topher1120/EchoServer](https://github.com/topher1120/EchoServer))for the sample server it executes against.
